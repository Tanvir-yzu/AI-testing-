**A collection of Jupyter Notebooks for exploring and testing AI/ML concepts.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various aspects of AI and machine learning.  The notebooks utilize Python libraries for data analysis, model training, and evaluation. The focus appears to be on practical application and experimentation rather than a cohesive, deployable application.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Notebooks demonstrate data loading, cleaning, and transformation techniques using Pandas.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:**  Examples showcase training and evaluating various machine learning models (specific models will need to be determined by analyzing the notebooks themselves).
- **Data Visualization:**  Data visualization techniques are used to explore datasets and model performance (specific libraries will need to be determined).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, (others to be determined from notebook dependencies)
- **Data Formats:** CSV, JSON, XLSX

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvir-yzu/AI-testing-.git
   cd AI-testing-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open Jupyter Notebook in your browser.  Open the desired `.ipynb` file to begin exploring.

## ⚙️ Configuration

No specific configuration files are present beyond the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 🧪 Testing

Testing is implicitly done within the Jupyter Notebooks themselves through code execution and visual inspection of results. There is no dedicated testing framework.  The `test.ipynb` notebook may contain examples of testing specific model outputs.
